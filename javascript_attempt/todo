- moving edges
- bounded levels
- add first row of polygons first
- add point, point location
    - search through triangles
    - binary answer, in/out

declan:
- formatting
- interactive triangles

dreaming:
- resize triangles on level add
- animate transitions
- comment out move polygon when adding to layers to get cool effect

- convex hull triangulation
